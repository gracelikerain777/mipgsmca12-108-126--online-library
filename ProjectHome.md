My project is Online Library. It is a web service. It allows user to create an account and store documents, e.books,articles etc. Users can retrieve required documents by giving a query.this web service searched in the collection and displays links to relevant books, articles and documents. It uses some searching algorithms to search in the collection. It mainly works based on Information Retrieval System(IRS). It is just an application of IRS. It uses some algorithms like Vector Space Model, Probabilistic Model to count relevance of documents.
